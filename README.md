Docker image for [Apache JMeter](http://jmeter.apache.org).
The aim is to have a Docker image that can be run as the ``jmeter`` command
itself.

## Building

With the script [build.sh](build.sh) the Docker image can be build
from the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) but this is not really necessary as
you may use your own ``docker build`` commandline.

### Build Options

Build argumments (see [build.sh](build.sh)) with default values if not passed to build:

- **JMETER_VERSION** - JMeter version, default ``3.3``
- **IMAGE_TIMEZONE** - timezone of Docker image, default ``"US/Pacific"``

NB **IMAGE_TIMEZONE** setting is not working yet.

## Running

The Docker image will accept the same parameters as ``jmeter`` itself, assuming
you run JMeter non-GUI with ``-n``.

There is a shorthand [run.sh](run.sh) command.
See [test.sh](test.sh) for an example of how to call [run.sh](run.sh).

## User Defined Variables

This is a standard facility of JMeter: settings in a JMX test script
may be defined symbolically and substituted at runtime via the commandline.
These are called JMeter User Defined Variables or UDVs.

See [test.sh](test.sh) and the [trivial test plan](tests/trivial/test-plan.jmx) for an example of UDVs passed to the Docker 
image via [run.sh](run.sh).

## Specifics

The Docker image built from the 
[Dockerfile](Dockerfile) inherits from the [Alpine Linux](https://www.alpinelinux.org) distribution:

> "Alpine Linux is built around musl libc and busybox. This makes it smaller 
> and more resource efficient than traditional GNU/Linux distributions. 
> A container requires no more than 8 MB and a minimal installation to disk 
> requires around 130 MB of storage. 
> Not only do you get a fully-fledged Linux environment but a large selection of packages from the repository."

See https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine/ for Alpine Docker images.

The Docker image will install (via Alpine ``apk``) several required packages most specificly
the ``OpenJDK Java JRE``.  JMeter is installed by simply downloading/unpacking a ``.tgz`` archive
from http://mirror.serversupportforum.de/apache/jmeter/binaries within the Docker image.

A generic [entrypoint.sh](entrypoint.sh) is copied into the Docker image and
will be the script that is run when the Docker container is run. The
[entrypoint.sh](entrypoint.sh) simply calls ``jmeter`` passing all argumets provided
to the Docker container, see [run.sh](run.sh) script:

```
sudo docker run --name ${NAME} -i -v ${WORK_DIR}:${WORK_DIR} -w ${WORK_DIR} ${IMAGE} $@
```
